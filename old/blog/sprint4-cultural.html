    <h1>Neuroplasticity & Growth Mindset: What are these & how to implement these in your life</h1>

<h3>Neuroplasticity</h3>
        <p>Neuroplasticity refers to the brain’s ability to adapt and it’s important because “When your brain gets injured or 
            damaged by disease, neuroplasticity allows you to recover. Your brain reorganises its physical structure and the 
            way it functions according to your environment.”

        <p>
            Our brains are truly extraordinary; unlike computers, which are built to certain specifications and receive 
            software updates periodically, our brains can actually receive hardware updates in addition to software updates. 
            Different pathways form and fall dormant, are created and are discarded, according to our experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
                When we learn something new, we create new connections between our neurons. We rewire our brains to adapt 
                to new circumstances. This happens on a daily basis, but it’s also something that we can encourage and stimulate.

                <p>
                    Two principles that help explain how neuroplasticity can benefit everyone are: </p>
                    <ul>
<li> Use it or lose it </li>
<li> Practice makes permanent </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The first principle means that if you stop doing something, for example if you stop chewing your food or ban yourself 
    from playing video games for a very long time(probably years), you will slowly lose the skills to do these things. 
    When you’re chewing the food or playing games you are making connections in your brain, your neural circuits are very 
    active during these tasks. But if you stop doing these things then your neural circuit is not actively engaged, therefore 
    they will start to degrade meaning you’ll become ‘rusty’ at these tasks. 
</p>
<p>
    Being aware of this principle can help you realise the importance of using your skills so that you don’t lose them (just think of the many skills you use at work or at home) and if there are new skills you are working on - you may lose ‘old’ skills that you’re no longer using day to day. 
</p>
<p>
    For myself, it reminds me that I might lose my design skills (last time I done any graphic design work was before the first big lockdown)  if I don’t find ways to implement time to keep practicing - luckily, I have small opportunities to use design skills during my study at DevAcademy,  as I’m responsible for creating/styling blogs, one of which you’re currently reading!
</p>
<p>
    The second principle, Practice makes permanent, I really love as it’s pretty much the opposite of the first principle. By practicing a skill, you make it permanent in your brain meaning you become a master in it. But, there are conditions to how you ‘practice’. For this principle to be true, you must practice:

</p>
<ul>
    <li> <b> repeatedly: </b> the more often you practice a skill, the better you become </li>
    <li> <b> intensely: </b> it shouldn’t be too easy, or too hard</li>
    <li> <b> using time: </b> you may need a short or long time to improve</li>
    <li> <b> with meaning: </b> don’t just pick any skill just for the sake of it, there should be some kind of meaning or importance as to why you’re practicing the skill in the first place
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Being aware of this, will really help you be aware of your current skills and also help you realise your potential for mastering new skills. For myself, this principle serves as a good reminder that I will become an awesome coder as long as I practice everyday, invest a good amount of time and work at a level that is challenging enough.

<h3>4 ways to increase neuroplasticity</h3>
<ol>
    <li> <b> Get enough sleep: </b> Your brain needs sleep to reset brain connections that are important for memory and learning. For adults 26 to 64 years old, the National Sleep Foundation recommends 7 to 9 hours of sleep per day.</li>
    <li> <b> Continue learning and keep moving: </b> The brain benefits from learning the way your body benefits from exercise. </li>
    <li> <b> Reduce stress: </b> Stress is a silent killer, and it also diminishes neuroplasticity. If you can’t reduce the sources of stress in your life, you can change how you respond to it. An excellent way to de-stress is to surround yourself with nature or to travel. Meditation is another way to control your stress responses.</li>
    <li> <b> Find a strong purpose for what you’re planning to learn: </b> Dr Michael Merzenich, author of Soft-Soft-Wired: How the New Science of Brain Plasticity Can Change Your Life says that brain change will be more significant if you’re motivated and alert. If you find a good reason for learning, then you will try harder and focus more on the task.</li>
</ol>

 <h3> The Growth Mindset</h3>
 <p>
    Growth mindset and fixed mindset(the opposition) were terms coined by Dr. Carol Dweck 30 years ago and what they do, is describe the underlying beliefs people have about learning and intelligence.
 </p>
 <p> Here’s an example of the growth mindset process:</p>

    <br>
    <p>
        Having a growth mindset is the belief that your brain can grow, and it’s true! It's been proven by neuroscientists that the brain is far more malleable than we ever knew.
    </p>
    <p>
        A growth mindset can definitely be relevant throughout our lives because it improves our capability to succeed. “(With a) growth mindset, they take on challenges and learn from them, therefore increasing their abilities and achievement.” 
    </p>
    <p>
        One thing that surprised me during this exploration of growth mindset was how the type of praise you receive can impact your mindset. As a parent of three, exploring this subject will change the way I engage with my kids and one way is by praising them for their efforts rather than intelligence. “For example, studies on different kinds of praise have shown that telling children they are smart encourages a fixed mindset, whereas praising hard work and effort cultivates a growth mindset.“

    <h3> 12 Ways to Develop a Growth Mindset <i> (for my learning journey)</i> </h3>
    <ol>
        <li> <b> Acknowledge and embrace imperfections:</b> Hiding from your weaknesses means you’ll never overcome them. </li>
        <li> <b> View challenges as opportunities:</b> Having a growth mindset means relishing opportunities for self-improvement. </li>
        <li> <b> Replace the word “failing” with the word “learning” or “not yet”: </b> Don’t be afraid or embarrassed of making mistakes or falling short of a goal - there is no failing, only learning! </li>
        <li> <b> Take risks in the company of others:</b>  Stop trying to save face all the time and just let yourself goof up now and then. It will make it easier to take risks in the future.</li>
        <li> <b> Think realistically about time and effort:</b>  It takes time to learn. Don’t expect to master every topic under the sun in one sitting.</li>
        <li> <b> Learn from other people’s mistakes.</b>  It’s not always wise to compare yourself to others, but it is important to realise that humans share the same weaknesses.</li>
        <li> <b> Make a new goal for every goal accomplished.</b> You’ll never be done learning. Just because your midterm exam is over doesn’t mean you should stop being interested in a subject. Growth-minded people know how to constantly create new goals to keep themselves stimulated. </li>
        <li> <b> Cultivate grit.</b>  Students with that extra bit of determination will be more likely to seek approval from themselves rather than others.</li>
        <li> <b> Reflect often.</b>  Let myself reflect on learning at least once a day.</li>
        <li> <b> Cultivate a sense of purpose.</b> Keep the bigger picture in mind. </li>
        <li> <b> Celebrate growth with others.</b> If you truly appreciate growth, you’ll want to share your progress with others. </li>
        <li> <b> Emphasise growth over speed:</b>  Learning fast isn’t the same as learning well, and learning well sometimes requires allowing time for mistakes.</li>
    </ol>
