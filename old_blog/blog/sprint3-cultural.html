        <h1>Emotional Intelligence (EQ)</h1>
        
      <h3>What is EQ? </h3>
      <p>EQ is the capacity to be aware of, control, and express one’s emotions, and to handle 
          interpersonal relationships empathetically and with good judgement and sense.
          “Emotional intelligence is part knowledge, part restraint and part wisdom. 
          Just as we spend years going to school to build our IQ, we need to spend time each and 
          every day working on our EQ.”</p>

        <br>

      <h3>How is it different to IQ? </h3>
      <p>EQ and IQ are completely different despite they can both be measured through standardised 
          testing! (And your scores are never set in stone, you can improve in both areas as long 
          as you put in the effort.) IQ is a number representing a person's reasoning ability (measured using problem-solving 
          tests) as compared to the statistical norm or average for their age, multiplied by 100.
          (Oxford definition)</p>

        <br>

      <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
      <p>Cultivating a high EQ helps you perform better, become a better leader and most important 
          - makes you happier! "Researchers have shown that our success at work or in life depends on Emotional 
          Intelligence by 80% and only 20% of intellect. While our intellect help us to resolve problems, 
          to make the calculations or to process information, Emotional intelligence allows us to 
          be more creative and use our emotions to resolve our problems.” </p>

        Personally, I have had someone tell me I'm emotionally intelligent, but at the time I had no idea what that meant - I think
        my first thought was that it was something to do with being familiar with understanding and dealing with emotions whether it was my own or someone else's.
        After researching the subject, I would say I am familiar with EQ although not an expert at it so now that I'm aware, I'd really like to grow it.
        There's a kiwi who wrote a really good <a href="https://www.talkingworks.co.nz/Articles/emotions/beginners+guide+to+emotional+intelligence.html"> article </a>  
        and it includes some simple steps to growing your EQ - from novice to advanced level, here are a few excerpts that really spoke to me:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b> A good starting point would be simply to recognize the subject itself as being important to you...Also, you will need a willingness to work with your own difficult feelings, whatever they may be, e.g. like sadness depression, loneliness or hurt.   </b></li>
        <li><b> Usually when individuals start out...a lot of work is done by reflection looking back on what went well or badly...it takes a high level of skill to catch yourself in the heat of an emotion. 
          You will not only need to catch your own emotional reactivity in the moment you will also need to find the pause button and start to use it, so that you don’t just go with the flow and repeat old destructive patterns of behavior. Sometimes noticing your own breathing, and making the choice to change to slower and deeper breathing can help in these situations.</b></li>
        <li><b> At an advanced level...you will have an increased awareness of the emotional world other people are experiencing and be interested in helping them through it, especially when they are struggling with what I call “prickly” feelings. This ability is often called empathy and is a fairly rare human trait, we need a lot more of it in the world.  </b></li>
        <li><b> Finally at a very advanced level of emotional intelligence you will have the ability to hold on to your own emotional reactivity when someone else is feeling emotionally overwhelmed, and not get reactive your self. To be there for them and to work through the issues to resolution where possible.  </b></li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        (The final bullet point is something I would really love to master)
