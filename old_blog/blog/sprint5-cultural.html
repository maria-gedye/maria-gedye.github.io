        <h3> <i> With bootcamp on the horizon, I take time to reflect & renew my learning plan... </i></h3>
          <p><em> 2 October 2020</em></p>

      <h3> What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h3>
      <p>
        I think my learning journey through foundations has made my ego fluctuate... 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b> I became more comfortable with myself through my peers and my lovely facilitator by trying to speak up for help and reach out/check in on others. </b> </li>
        <li><b> Realising how difficult it can be to understand JS in 5 weeks definitely brought me back down to earth! </b> </li>
        <li><b> Initially, I was a very visual thinker so I've had to learn to think in new ways to immerse myself into the code world. </b> </li>
        <li><b> Its safe to say I enjoyed the core learning the most. </b> </li>
      </ul>
      
    
      <h3> What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b> A person's values are positive influences on their learning/programming and they will rub off in some way or another. </b></li>
        <li><b> Empathy enables you to understand diverse viewpoints/approaches (in both learning & programming) or at least it 
          brings awareness that there are actually many different viewpoints in every situation. </b></li>
        <li><b> Self awareness proves how much you understand yourself and in turn can help you to better understand others. </b></li>
      </ul>
      
      
      <h3> What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
      <p>
        The type of questions we had to answer in the <a href= "http://maria-gedye.github.io/maria-gedye.github.io/blog/sprint1-core.html"> first </a> cultural blog did it for me. I was worried I overshared and then shortly after those worries subsided, and I felt relief.
      </p>

      <h3> What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
      <p>
        Probably sticking within the timeboxes - I think the majority of them were only an hour or so and sometimes I would get carried away researching things for my blogs and then I needed another hour or so to structure my blogs in code and then check for bugs etc. It's the end of foundations and I still have bugs on every blog page as I write this!
      </p>
      
      <h3> Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h3>
      <p>
        Because employers don't want to hire a**holes? It reminds me of the IT department at my last job, the majority of the team were contractors and 
        if they survived what seemed like a trial period, they were then offered a permanent role (if they wanted it!). A LOT of them came and went especially
        during my last year there (the company was going through a rebrand). For some, contracting might be unsustainable depending on their business structure.
      </p>
      
      <h3> Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing 
          programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
      <p>
        No I'm very grateful for the core learning as there were some aspects such as the meditating and listen and looping that have flowed into
        other areas of my life outside of study. I can say the things I've learnt is making me a better, healthier person, little by little each day.
      </p>

      <h1>Learning Plan 2.0</h1>
      <p><i> What is your long term goal and/or career pathway? </i></p>
      <p><b> Upon graduating, I'll be looking for work I find meaningful - I think of projects that maybe tackle serious issues in our society and to dig deeper, probably issues that affect me personally.
        Long term (like 10 years+) I want to progress towards a senior/specialist role that is embedded in ethical design and/or ethical programming. </b></p>
      
    
      
      
      <p><i> What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp? </i></p>
      <p><b> OMG just re-read my strengths & limitations from <a href="http://maria-gedye.github.io/maria-gedye.github.io/blog/sprint2-cultural.html"> sprint 2 </a> and they were so onpoint - I experienced
        each one at least once throughout foundations...look, I wouldn't be surprised at all to see these things happening again during bootcamp. Maybe a new strength && limitation I would add
        would be my health - it did hinder me a bit due to some conditions mentioned in my first core blog but with exercise, meditation and asking for help (medically and personally) 
        will ensure I overcome future obstacles. Same with my limitation "too sensitive", after some very useful feedback from my facilitator, I was able
        to take in a new perception and see it as a wonderful strength and something I don't want to lose. Losing my sensitivity to myself and others will
        most definitely affect my levels of empathy and other related skills. </b></p>

      <p><i> What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be? </i></p>
      <p><b> Yes, I would say keeping myself sane and not burning out over the next 9 weeks is the first thing that comes to mind. </b></p>

      <p><i> What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA? </i></p>
      <p><b> I would love to develop leadership skills, this is something I've become curious about since the core learning journey. I want to be able to give feedback that isn't 
        too blunt and I would love to really improve my presentation skills as the thought of presenting in front of others makes me cringe. </b></p>

      <p><i> What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp </i></p>
      <p><b> I will commit to giving the bootcamp my best shot. Using the tools I have learnt, along with family and EDA support, this is the hierarchy:
        Health comes first, family & workload; tied second and then I will do my best to support and learn from
       my peers and hopefully, make some great connections that go beyond the next 9 weeks! As a solo parent of 3 humans and 2 cats I have reached out
       for extra support, including weekends so that I can study the suggested 60+ hours a week. One thing I will change is reaching out to EDA staff 
       more often, and sooner rather than later. This will be easier since we will all be working on campus. </b></p>
