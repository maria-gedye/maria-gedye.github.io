    <h1 class="child-2">This h1 element has the position: absolute; top: 35%; right: -25px;</h1>

    <h3 class="child-3">This h3 element also has position: absolute; bottom: -100px; left: 10px;</h3> 

    <p>This p element is static and doesn't move. All three child elements are sitting within a div element(which is this green box) that is set
      to position: relative; which is why the h1 and h3 elements can only position themselves using the parent relative element
      as a reference.
