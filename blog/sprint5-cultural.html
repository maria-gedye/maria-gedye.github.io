      <h3> What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h3>
      <p>
        I think my learning journey through foundations has made my ego fluctuate... 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b> I became more comfortable with myself through my peers and my lovely facilitator by trying to speak up for help and reach out/check in on others. </b> </li>
        <li><b> Realising how difficult it can be to understand JS in 5 weeks definitely brought me back down to earth! </b> </li>
        <li><b> Initially, I was a very visual thinker so I've had to learn to think in new ways to immerse myself into the code world. </b> </li>
        <li><b> Its safe to say I enjoyed the core learning the most. </b> </li>
      </ul>
      
    
      <h3> What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b> A person's values are positive influences on their learning/programming and they will rub off in some way or another. </b></li>
        <li><b> Empathy enables you to understand diverse viewpoints/approaches (in both learning & programming) or at least it 
          brings awareness that there are actually many different viewpoints in every situation. </b></li>
        <li><b> Self awareness proves how much you understand yourself and in turn can help you to better understand others. </b></li>
      </ul>
      
      
      <h3> What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
      <p>
        The type of questions we had to answer in the <a href= "http://maria-gedye.github.io/maria-gedye.github.io/blog/sprint1-core.html"> first </a> cultural blog did it for me. I was worried I overshared and then shortly after those worries subsided, and I felt relief.
      </p>

      <h3> What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
      <p>
        Probably sticking within the timeboxes - I think the majority of them were only an hour or so and sometimes I would get carried away researching things for my blogs and then I needed another hour or so to structure my blogs in code and then check for bugs etc. It's the end of foundations and I still have bugs on every blog page as I write this!
      </p>
      
      <h3> Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h3>
      <p>
        Because employers don't want to hire a**holes? It reminds me of the IT department at my last job, the majority of the team were contractors and 
        if they survived what seemed like a trial period, they were then offered a permanent role (if they wanted it!). A LOT of them came and went especially
        during my last year there (the company was going through a rebrand). For some, contracting might be unsustainable depending on their business structure.
      </p>
      
      <h3> Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing 
          programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
      <p>
        No I'm very grateful for the core learning as there were some aspects such as the meditating and listen and looping that have flowed into
        other areas of my life outside of study. I can say the things I've learnt is making me a better, healthier person, little by little each day.
