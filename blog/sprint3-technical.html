    <h1>An Intro to JavaScript, the DOM and DevTools</h1>

    <h3>Today, we're diving into the DOM, DevTools and some components of JavaScript; control flow and loops, arrays and objects, and functions.</h3> 
<p><em> 21 September 2020</em></p>
    <br>
    
<h3>We start with a webpage...</h3>
        <p>If you don't know by now, HTML, CSS and Javascript are key components of a webpage.
            HTML defines the structure like the bones and organs inside our wonderful human bodies and CSS provides 
            the styling which would be our unique features such as curly hair, blue eyes and skin colour.
            In the DOM, HTML uses tags for things like headings and images which flow down a page and CSS 
            uses properties and values to instruct how your elements will appear - don't worry, we will explain what the DOM 
            is in a minute.  </p>
           
            <div class="flex-parent flex-margin">

            </div>

        <p>And then there's JavaScript which provides the interactive/magical stuff. Here are just some of the things it is capable of:
            play with media; remembers where users left off; do things with users' mouse clicks, keyboard taps, and finger presses; use fancy navigation menus; 
            animations; interact with webcams/microphones; not require a page reload/navigation for any kind of action.
            </p>

<h3>Let's explore the DOM, Window, Document & Nodes</h3>
        <p> 
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WD-DOM/introduction.html">W3</a> defines the DOM (The Document Object Model) as a "programming API 
            for documents. The object model itself closely resembles the structure of the documents it models.”
            
            The DOM is the glue that sets HTML, CSS and Javascript (the three key components of a webpage) together. It is an object 
            representation of these <a href="https://youtu.be/gT0Lh1eYk78">tres amigos.</a> By using JavaScript, the DOM can provide 
            direct access and allow you to modify any webpage via your document and window objects.
            </p>
            <p>This is what the DOM structure looks like:</p>
            <img class="shrink" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1*rj51V99e1zHaznxMCD2-0Q.png">
            <p>The root of your hierarchy is the window, which is a global object that contains many properties and methods 
                that help you work with your browser. </p>
                <p>  Underneath the window is the document which acts as the gateway to all the HTML elements on display. 
                It acts like a two-way street where you can read as well as manipulate at will. </p>
               
                <p> Keep in mind with the window and document:</p>
                <ul> 
            
                <li>  Some of the things you can do through the window object include: accessing the current URL, 
                    getting information about any frames in the page, using local storage, seeing information about your screen, 
                    fiddling with the scrollbar, setting the statusbar text, and all sorts of things that are applicable to the 
                    container your web page is displayed in. </li>
                    <li> In your document object, you can dynamically add elements, remove them, move them around, modify attributes on 
                them, set inline CSS styles, all inside the DOM using JavaScript.</li>
            </ul>
            <img class="shrink" src="https://blog.irowell.io/static/3e7812585d1431cb872725ecdb811301/8ab8a/window_vs_document.jpg">

               <p> The DOM is made up of nodes. Nodes are created by the browser and act as a type of mapping that lets you 
                   access and modify the code. Nodes can be any of the following: elements, attributes, text content, comments, 
                   document-related specs, and a few other things.
                </p>
            <br>
            <p>This is what the Node structure looks like:</p>

        <br>
        <h3>Control flow & loops what?</h3>
        <p>The control flow is the order in which the computer executes(carries out) statements in a script. 
            Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across 
            structures like conditionals and loops, which will change the control flow.  </p>

            <p> If I was a red ball placed at the top of a hill, I would naturally roll from the top to the bottom 
                just like how control flow runs code from the first line to the last line. But if that hill had an 
                elephant standing in the middle or a random road that cut through it then that would change my ‘flow’ 
                as I could get stuck in the elephant or could diverge down the random road which takes me back to the 
                top of the hill. In code, the elephant or random road would be a conditional or loop which would also 
                change the order in which the code flowed.</p>
            
                <p>Loops let you repeat code many times using instructions. To do this, you specify the conditions in 
                    brackets and javaScript will execute these. If there is no limit specified, it will keep repeating 
                    until you put in a (break;)</p>
            
            <p>Loops are blocking operations - but not quite as friendly as animation blocks. When you use loops 
                it blocks all operations to your code so be careful to make sure you’re not relying on them to do 
                interactive things or working with millions of items or it could cause freezing on the UI.</p>
            
                <h3>Arrays vs. Objects</h3>
                <p>Objects and arrays both store data: to access and modify the data within these, object uses properties 
                    and arrays use indexing. </p>
                    <ul>
                    <li> Objects look like: var objectName = {“key”: “value”, “key two”: “value two”}; </li>
                    <li> Arrays look like: var arrayName = [“dog”, 23,] </li>
                </ul>
                   <p> Objects are similar to arrays except that instead of using indexes to access and modify data 
                    you use properties to access the data. Objects are useful for storing data in a 
                    structured way and can represent real world objects like a dog. You can even use single-word string 
                    properties without quotes.  </p>
        <p>
                    To declare an array, use square brackets and separate entries with a comma  [“dog”, “cat”, 5].
                    You can nest arrays within other arrays (called a multi-dimensional array). </p>
                    <p>
                    Just like in strings we can use indexes[number] which will specify an entry inside the array. 
                    Note: make sure there are no spaces between the array name and the square brackets so it looks like this:
                     array[3]; and not array [3];</p>
                    <p>
                    One important difference is that arrays are mutable unlike strings which are immutable therefore can be 
                    changed freely. Again, make sure there are no spaces between array names and square brackets!
                      </p>
                      <br>
        <h3>And finally, Functions</h3>
                <p>JavaScript functions are used to perform operations. We can call JavaScript function many times to 
                    reuse the code.</p>

                    <p>Why are they useful?</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li> Code reusability: We can call a function several times so it save coding. </li>
                    <li> Less coding: It makes our program compact. We don’t need to write many lines of code each time to 
                    perform a common task. </li>
                </ul>
