        <h1>Emotional Intelligence (EQ)</h1>
        
        <h2>What is EQ? </h2>
        <p>EQ is the capacity to be aware of, control, and express one’s emotions, and to handle 
            interpersonal relationships empathetically and with good judgement and sense.</p>
<p><em>“Emotional intelligence is part knowledge, part restraint and part wisdom. 
    Just as we spend years going to school to build our IQ, we need to spend time each and 
    every day working on our EQ.” </em> [TTI] [1] </p>


<h2>How is it different to IQ? </h2>
<p>EQ and IQ are completely different despite they can both be measured through standardised 
    testing! (And your scores are never set in stone, you can improve in both areas as long 
    as you put in the effort.) </p>

<p>IQ is a number representing a person's reasoning ability (measured using problem-solving 
    tests) as compared to the statistical norm or average for their age, multiplied by 100.
    (Oxford definition)</p>

<p>The difference is IQ ensures success in school and EQ ensures success in life.</p>

<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Cultivating a high EQ helps you perform better, become a better leader and most important 
    - makes you happier!</p>
	
<p><em>“Researchers have shown that our success at work or in life depends on Emotional 
    Intelligence 80% and only20% of intellect. While our intellect help us to resolve problems, 
    to make the calculations or to process information Emotional intelligence (EQ) allows us to 
    be more creative and use our emotions to resolve our problems.” [2] </em></p>
