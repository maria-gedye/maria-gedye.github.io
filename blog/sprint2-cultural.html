        <h1>Maria’s Learning Plan</h1>
       
       <h3>What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</h3>
       <p>In terms of career pathway I’d like to expand from being a graphic designer to a 
           digital designer with knowledge of web and other areas or maybe I’d like to work full 
           time as a web developer for a few years. I’m not really fussed on job titles, I’m more 
           wanting to find diverse and creative workspaces and employers who encourage growth. In 
           10 years time I’d love to be an Art/Creative Director.</p>

           <h3>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h3>
<p>Skills I’d like to develop while I study would be my communication: I’d like to be more confident in 
presenting my ideas and/or starting discussions with my cohort. Problem solving and creativity are 
also skills I’d love to develop during my time as a student.</p>

<h3>A description of your own strengths and limitations</h3>
<p>My strengths are tolerant, reliable, charisma, altruism and natural leader which are traits that 
    make me a ‘people-person’. I like being around people, helping them and accomplishing things 
    together. My limitations are too idealistic/selfless/sensitive, fluctuating self-esteem and 
    struggle to make tough decisions which I think are downfalls from being around people all the time. 
    If I become too focused on other people’s struggles or voices, I run the risk of neglecting my own 
    struggles and/or voice so it pays for me to take ‘breathers’ and check in with myself. Help myself 
    before I help others kind-of-thing.</p>

    <h3>Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h3>
<p>My strengths will enable me to be a good team player and I think I should be able to get along with 
    the majority of people. I will make an effort to not get distracted by people or be a distraction 
    myself and I will keep this in mind. Ways to do this could be limiting the amount of times I go on 
    Slack(or my phone) or having a set time to check messages(like checking first thing after writing half of my 
    4 questions and once again after lunch break) and just by focusing on the work. </p>

<p>My limitations (too idealistic/selfless/sensitive, fluctuating self-esteem and struggle to make 
    tough decisions) tie into the last point of not being distracted or being the distraction itself.
     I want to be more open to criticism and take it with a grain of salt, which I think I’m more than 
     ready to try. I also want to share my own opinions more which has been a past struggle as I feel
      it makes me vulnerable but at the same time it’s better for people to know what I truly think or 
      believe in - honesty is one of my close-guarded values after all! Ways to do the last point is by 
      asking my cohort and facilitator for more or specific feedback e.g. instead of asking “Let me know 
      what you think” I could ask someone for their view(politely) on something specific: “Hey @person 
      I really like your use of padding and margins on your index page, what are ways I could improve 
      mine?”</p>

      <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h3>
<p>The technical side of this course, I’ve just realised, will be the weaker side so when I get 
    stuck my first port of call is google. I just have to really understand the problem first so 
    that I can ask the right questions to get a solution. If I fail that way after a few attempts, 
    then I will ask on Slack on the #foundations channel although I know there is a #code-help-desk 
    channel as well. Usually at least one person will reply. If for some reason I am still stuck and 
    I’m falling behind time I will try and see if I can change the work(usually its css code not 
    working the way I want it to) and find an alternative way to achieve the task. </p>

    <h3>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h3>
<p>To be honest, I don’t think I expect as much as I would from another tertiary school. The fact 
    that we’re working from home and that the facilitators also have very busy schedules alongside 
    teaching bootcamp students tells me I shouldn’t rely on these guys too much during the 
    foundation weeks. I think this mentality will change when I start the bootcamp in October. 
    Although, if I was having serious issues with managing workload, harassment from a fellow 
    student etc then I would definitely contact Emily!</p>

    <h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.</h3>
<p>Scheduling information: So I wake up early, get the kids off to school at 8.30am every morning. 
    I get back home between 8.40am-9.00am except on Tuesdays where I go do the grocery shopping 
    and then get back home about 10am. I carry out a mixture of study, exercise/housework and 
    small breaks throughout the day and finish between 5pm-6pm. After that I pick my kids up from 
    my mum’s and do dinner, spend time with family and then get them off to bed between 8.30pm-9pm. 
    Friday after-school, I have my two oldest kids stay at their dad’s until Sunday noon, so I will 
    use this window to catch up with my studies.</p>
