    <h1>An Intro to Relative, Absolute and Fixed Positioning</h1>

 <h3>So what are they?</h3>
        <p>The terms 'relative' 'absolute' and 'fixed' are the names of CSS positions and we use these "to manipulate 
            how elements are positioned(on a html page) to achieve different visual effects" and layouts. There are actually five values in total
            that sit under CSS Positioning:         </p>

        <p>I'm going to give an introduction on the static position as well as the other three in the title but before we move on,
            there is one important concept to grasp first and that is: Every single element on a web page is a block. "Literally
            a rectangle of pixels. This means you can set a width and a height and that element will respect that." There's more 
            explanation on this <a href="https://css-tricks.com/absolute-relative-fixed-positioining-how-do-they-differ/">here</a> <!--add url here-->
        </p>

        <h1>Static</h1>
        <p> All page elements are positioned as static by default. This means the element will stay put and should appear as 
            you'd expect it to on your page.
        </p>

        <h1>Relative</h1>
        <p>The name could be defined as "relative to itself" so if you were to set an element with the position: relative; this element
            is no longer in the static position. Visually, your element will still look the same until you add some positioning attributes (top, left,
            bottom, right). If you were to add left: 5px; it would shift or nudge its position 5 pixels in the opposite direction(it would appear 
            to move 5 pixels to the right). If you were to also add top: 20px; it will shift 20 pixels downwards from its original position.
        </p>
        <p>Once you set an element's position to relative, there are two things to be aware of:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Elements with the relative position can now have a z-index property added</li>
                <p>(this is used for stacking elements in a specific order, kind of like the "bring forward/backward" action in powerpoint and photoshop)</p>
                <li>Any child elements with the position: absolute; (we talk about absolute next), will be limited to being positioned
                    within that parent element. </li>
            </ol> <!--add a useful img here-->

        <h1>Absolute</h1>
        <p> The name could be defined as "viewed or existing independently" and can come in very handy as this type of positioning allows 
            you to set any element exactly where you want it. If you were to set a new element with the position: absolute; this is no longer
            in the static position. This absolute element has now been 'removed from the flow' of elements on the page which means
            it is not affected by other elements and it doesn't affect other elements; like it's sitting in
            its own layer. 
        </p>
<p>So now you can add positioning attributes (top, left, bottom, right) to set the location which will always
    be relative to the closest parent element with relative(or absolute) positioning. Using negative values
    (bottom: -100px) will place your absolute elements outside of their containing elements.
</p>

    <p><em>Please note:</em></p>
    <ul>
        <li>"If there is no such parent
            it will default all the way back up to the html element itself meaning it will be placed relative to the page itself".</li>
            <li>Be careful with how many elements you set to absolute as "overuse or improper use can
                limit the flexibility of your site".</li>
    </ul> 

        <h1>Fixed</h1>
        <p>Finally we have fixed and this position is always relative to the browser window itself. When you give
            an element the position: fixed; it will stay in the same place, even when you scroll down the page. Just like
            the absolute position, this also takes it 'out of the flow' so it does not affect the other static or
            relative elements on your page.
        </p>

        <p>Typical uses for position: fixed; would be a navigation bar but a common problem with fixed headers is
            that they can get in the way of elements that you may be trying to link to. There is a good solution
            to this problem and that is found <a href="https://css-tricks.com/fixed-headers-and-jump-links-the-solution-is-scroll-margin-top/">here</a>
